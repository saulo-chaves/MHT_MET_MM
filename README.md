# Application of linear mixed models for multiple harvest/site trials analyses in perennial plant breeding

This page's data and R scripts refer to the paper https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-022-01576-5. Feel free to use it and contact me if there are any issues. 

This pages has two folders:

1- Data - Contains both data sets we used in the paper. D1 refers to a cupuassu tree data set, with 25 families evaluated over 12 harvest years. D2 refers to a eucalytpus dataset, with 215 clones evaluated in 4 environments. 

2- Scripts - Contains the scripts we used for the multi-harvest data set (D1) and the multi-environment data set (D2). You can make the necessary adjustments and applied it to your own data set.

This page also has a R project named "MHT_MET_MM.Rproj". If you clone the repository, you can use the R project to perform the analyses yourself. 

Regards!
